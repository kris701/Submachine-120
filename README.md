# Submachine 120

This was a small map design project that i made for the game Garrys Mod. It is inspired by a little game series called [Submachine](https://submachine.fandom.com/wiki/Submachine_series). So i made a little map, where the idea is that the combines also found the Submachine somehow and entered it. However it is quite clear for the player that it didnt really go that well, just like it didnt go well for everyone else that entered.
